# Square Root Bisection Calculator

## Description
This project calculates the square root of a given number using the bisection method. The algorithm iteratively narrows down the possible range of square roots, ensuring accurate results within a specified tolerance.

## Features
- Handles special cases for inputs 0 and 1.
- Provides precise square root approximations for positive numbers.
- Customizable tolerance and maximum iteration limits.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
