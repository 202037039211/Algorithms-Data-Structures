# Projectile Trajectory Calculator

## Description
This Python project calculates and visualizes the trajectory of a projectile given its initial speed, height, and angle. It outputs the calculated displacement, trajectory coordinates, and a simple ASCII graph to represent the motion.

## Features
- Calculates the horizontal displacement.
- Generates the (x, y) coordinates of the projectile's path.
- Displays a text-based graph of the trajectory.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No additional libraries required.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
