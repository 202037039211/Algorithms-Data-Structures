# Merge Sort Algorithm

This project implements the merge sort algorithm, a divide-and-conquer sorting technique.

## How It Works:
1. **Divide:** The array is split into two halves.
2. **Conquer:** Each half is sorted recursively.
3. **Combine:** The sorted halves are merged together in order.

## Usage:
- Run the script with a predefined array or customize the `numbers` list.
- The output will display the unsorted and sorted arrays.

## Example:
- Input: `[4, 10, 6, 14, 2, 1, 8, 5]`
- Output: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14]`
