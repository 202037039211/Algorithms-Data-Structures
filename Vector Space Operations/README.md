# Vector Space Operations

## Description
This project defines two classes, `R2Vector` for 2D vectors and `R3Vector` for 3D vectors, with methods for basic vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot product, cross product, and comparison by magnitude.

## Features
- **R2Vector**: Handles basic vector operations for 2D vectors (addition, subtraction, dot product, etc.).
- **R3Vector**: Inherits from `R2Vector` and adds support for the cross product in 3D vectors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
