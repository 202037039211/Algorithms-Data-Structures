# Shortest Path Algorithm

## Description
This project implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths from a given starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph. It outputs the distance and path for each destination.

## Features
- Calculates the shortest distance from a starting node to all other nodes.
- Displays the path taken to reach each destination.
- Supports specifying a target node for focused pathfinding.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
