# Tower of Hanoi Solver

This project implements a solution to the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion. The program prints each step, showing how disks move between the three towers.

## Rules of Tower of Hanoi:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or an empty peg.
3. The goal is to move all disks from the source tower to the target tower.

## How to Run:
1. Set the number of disks in the `NUMBER_OF_DISKS` variable.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Observe the step-by-step solution printed in the console.

## Example:
For 3 disks, the output shows each move, demonstrating how the puzzle is solved.
